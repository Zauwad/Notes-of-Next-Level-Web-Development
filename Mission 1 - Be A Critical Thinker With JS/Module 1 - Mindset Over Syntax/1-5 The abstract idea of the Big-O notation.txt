Time and Space -> Measure

Time and Space Complexity

O(n)
O(n2)
O(logn)
O(nlogn)
O(1)

Have to keep in mind --> Time Complexity for now since space complexity is not a big issue now ( devices improved over the years ) 
AS a webdev time complexity much big issue



Big-O -> Not time specific. WILL ALWAYS FIND OUT FOR WORST CASE SCENARIO FOR ALGORITHM


Linear -> straight line -> O(n)
Constant -> O(1) -> MOST EFFICIENT!!
O(n2) -> Close to worst
O(n!) -> THE WORST!!!
