for () {
    ----      -> for this loop generally -> O(n)
}			  -> The more elements in array the more time increases

Big-O -> Always take account for worst case scenario. 



push, pop -> O(1) -> Because there is no loop here. Push function pushes a element at the end 
					and pop does vice varsa
					
Array[index] -> O(1) -> Because I'm getting a specific value; A one time action.  





shift, unshift -> O(n) -> Because unshift moves each element from first toward last,  		
							while adding another index at the end. Then places the value at the 
							start. So it works on each element. So O(n). Same goes for shift
Foreach, Map   -> O(n) -> Same reason

Array.find(), Array.includes -> O(n) -> Because it finds the element by going through each element of the array. 
							
							
O(n) -> Is linear
