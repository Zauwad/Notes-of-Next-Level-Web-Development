// To convert from typescript to javascript. We need compiler. By installing ts we get one at deafult

// TO compile we use tsc test3.ts

// TO configure by own wish, we use tsconfig.json similar to package.json -> tsc -- init
// We will write ts code in rootDir in config file -> Usually we will keep it in src folder
// And we will get compiled file in outDir

// "target": "esnext", can change it to any es version as per wish

// I can write code in modern version, ts compiler will change it to that target es version
